Blue was the first iOS app we launched at [Oak](http://oak.is/thinking/blue), and was designed and built in one week during our yearly team getaway. Blue provides 36-hour weather forecasts relevant to your location in a fast and fun interface. You can swipe up to see each hour represented in a colorful gradient visual, generated based on three variables: temperature, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.

I was responsible for conceptualizing and creating a marketing page for the app and decided the best way to explain the app was to show it in action and let it speak for itself. Over a period of 24 hours, using an iPad I recorded a timelapse of the Los Angeles cityscape from the balcony of the Airbnb we were staying at. From there I recreated the app's interface in HTML & CSS, then paired a CSS animation of the interface with the timelapse video background.
