Initially designed and built in one month at [Oak Studios](http://oak.is), Siteleaf has grown to become a formidable CMS for static websites. Our philosophy behind Siteleaf is that you should be able to host your website anywhere you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. That our tools should be simplified, not dumbed down. In version 2 we're adding 100% compatibility with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the same platform that powers over &frac12; million sites on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

As part of the 4 person team, I lead the design and front-end development of the CMS focusing on building powerful management controls while aiming to make it as simple and clear as possible for clients who may just want to update their damn site.

[Version 2 of Siteleaf will be out in early 2016](http://v2.siteleaf.com)
