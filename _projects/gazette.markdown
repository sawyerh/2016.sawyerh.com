Gazette was a product experiment I helped birth at [Oak Studios](http://oak.is). It allowed you to subscribe to your favorite blogs, websites, and publications and receive a weekly, personalized ebook to read and highlight on iOS, Kindle, or other device that supported ePub/Mobi formats. It synced issues with Readmill, Kindle, and also allowed you to download directly. Unfortunately it didn't take off how we would've liked and we decided to shelve the idea in 2014 in order to focus on other products.
