CreativeMornings is a breakfast lecture series for the creative community, founded by [Tina Roth Eisenberg](http://www.swiss-miss.com/). In 2012, after a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/swissmiss/creativemornings-creating-an-archive), they approached [Oak Studios](http://oak.is) to help design and build their online presence. As part of the team, I led the design and front-end development of the initial [CreativeMornings.com](http://creativemornings.com) which was translated into 11 languages, included over 350 hours of video and an administrative section for hosts to manage event registration and content. Over time, through our ongoing relationship with CreativeMornings, we've continued to lead the site's development, supporting a site that has grown to over 100k users, over 2k videos, and a presence in over 130 cities across the world.
