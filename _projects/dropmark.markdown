Dropmark is the smart way to organize all your links, files, and notes into visual collections. As part of the 3 person team at [Oak Studios](http://oak.is), I help shape the product vision, design, and development. In 2015, I focused on making the product self-sustaining, leading the creation of the [Teams](http://www.dropmark.com/teams/) offering, additional “Pro” features like [annotations](http://www.dropmark.com/blog/image-annotations/) and an overall improved user experience. In 2016, these efforts continue with an improved [browser extension](http://www.dropmark.com/blog/a-new-improved-browser-extension/) and a refresh to the Dropmark brand..
